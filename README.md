I am a Photoshop and design teacher turned to a front-end developer
I used to do programming with Asp in 200 years ago , and I was doing good , but then I shifted to teaching and design , I learned Photoshop by myself and even has some lectures in university , so I liked it too much , from one year on I began to   a web developing course in Tafe NSW and again I am making my HTML and CSS and add Javascript to my projects , I have learned how to code with PHP in 2 weeks and now I am very confident with it .
The next step is React.JS which I am working on it since last month and Yes it is the thing that I have born to do on the Earth!
